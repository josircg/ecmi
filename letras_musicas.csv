Taylor Swift,Cruel Summer,"Paroles de la chanson Cruel Summer par Taylor Swift
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got

And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone

Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know

Oh, it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)
Said, ""I'm fine,"" but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you

And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, ""For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?""
He looks up, grinning like a devil

It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

I'm drunk in the back of the car

And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)
Said, ""I'm fine,"" but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, ""For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?""

Taylor Swift,Love Story,"Paroles de la chanson Love Story par Taylor Swift
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run

You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel

This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""

Oh, oh

And I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

And I said, ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone

I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say 'Yes'""

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you",pop
Taylor Swift,I Did Something Bad,"Paroles de la chanson I Did Something Bad par Taylor Swift
I never trust a narcissist
But they love me
So I play 'em like a violin
And I make it look oh-so-easy
'Cause for every lie I tell them
They tell me three
This is how the world works
Now all he thinks about is me

I can feel the flames on my skin
Crimson red paint on my lips
If a man talks shit, then I owe him nothing
I don't regret it one bit, 'cause he had it coming

They say I did something bad, ah

Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did something bad, ah
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had, ah
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good

I never trust a playboy
But they love me
So I fly 'em all around the world
And I let them think they saved me
They never see it comin'

What I do next
This is how the world works
You gotta leave before you get left

I can feel the flames on my skin
He says, ""Don't throw away a good thing""
But if he drops my name, then I owe him nothin'
And if he spends my change, then he had it comin'

They say I did something bad, ah
Then why's it feel so good?

Taylor Swift,Red,"Paroles de la chanson Red (Taylor’s Version) par Taylor Swift
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead end street
Faster than the wind
Passionate as sin, ended so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind
Once you’re already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn
So bright just before they lose it all

Losing him was blue like I’d never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
But loving him was red
Loving him was red


Touching him is like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there’s no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out love could be that strong

Losing him was blue like I’d never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
But loving him was red
Oh red burning red

Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes

Tell myself it’s time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head

Burning red!
Darling it was red!

Oh, losing him was blue like I’d never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
Cause loving him was red yeah yeah red
We're burning red

And that's why he's spinning round in my head
Comes back to me burning red
Yeah yeah


Cause love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead end street",pop

Shoots up through the stony ground
There's no room
No space to rent in this town


You're out of luck

And the reason that you had to care

The traffic is stuck

And you're not moving anywhere





You thought you'd found a friend

To take you out of this place

Someone you could lend a hand

In return for grace





It's a beautiful day

Sky falls, you feel like

It's a beautiful day

Don't let it get away





You're on the road

But you've got no destination

You're in the mud

In the maze of her imagination





You love this town

Even if that doesn't ring true

You've been all over

And it's been all over you





It's a beautiful day

Don't let it get away

It's a beautiful day





Touch me

Take me to that other place

Teach me

I know I'm not a hopeless case





See the world in green and blue

See China right in front of you

See the canyons broken by cloud

See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out

See the Bedouin fires at night

See the oil fields at first light

And see the bird with a leaf in her mouth

After the flood all the colors came out





It was a beautiful day

Don't let it get away

Beautiful day





Touch me

Take me to that other place

Reach me

I know I'm not a hopeless case

And my pimp's a record label
This world is full of demons
Stocks and bonds and bible traders
So I do the deed
Get up and leave
A climber and a sadist, yeah

Are you ready for the sequel?
Ain't ready for the latest?
In the garden of evil
I'm gonna be the greatest
In a golden cathedral
I'll be praying for the faithless

And if you lose, boo-hoo

Hey look ma, I made it
Hey look ma, I made it
Everything's comin' up aces, aces
And if it’s a dream, don't wake me, don't wake me
I said hey look ma, I made it

Friends are happy for me
Or they're honeysuckle phonies
Then they celebrate my medals
Or they wanna take my trophies
Some are loyal soldiers
While these other thorns are rosy
And if you never know who you can trust
Then trust me, you'll be lonely, oh

While others don't

There's a thousand reasons

I should go about my day

And ignore your whispers

Which I wish would go away, ah ah oh oh

Oh oh



You're not a voice

You're just a ringing in my ear

And if I heard you, which I don't

I'm spoken for I fear

Everyone I've ever loved is here within these walls

I'm sorry, secret siren, but I'm blocking out your calls

I've had my adventure, I don't need something new

I'm afraid of what I'm risking if I follow you



Into the unknown

Ah ah ah ah ah

What do you want? 'Cause you've been keeping me awake

Are you here to distract me so I make a big mistake?

Or are you someone out there who's a little bit like me?

Who knows deep down I'm not where I'm meant to be?

Every day's a little harder as I feel your power grow

Don't you know there's part of me that longs to go



Into the unknown?

I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows
For my mind to run around, with my ear up to the ground
I'm searching to behold the stories that are told
When my back is to the world that was smiling when I turned

[ Dan Reynolds]
Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn, they hate us


[Dan Reynolds]
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy-y-y-y-y

Your words up on thе wall as you'rе prayin' for my fall
And the laughter in thе halls and the namеs that I've been called
I stack it in my mind, and I'm waiting for the time
When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic

Being a wreck of emotions
Ready to go whenever just let me know
The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor
The enemy's on my trail, my energy unavailable
I'ma tell 'em, ""Hasta luego""
They wanna plot on my trot to the top
I've been outta shape, thinkin' out the box
I'm an astronaut
I blasted off the planet rock to cause catastrophe
And it matters more because I had it not
Had I thought about wreaking havoc
On an opposition, kinda shockin'
They wanted static with precision
I'm automatic quarterback
I ain't talkin' sacking, pack it
Pack it up, I don't panic, batter-batter up

Who the baddest?

Got that good song in my feet

I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops

I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally

Under the lights when everything goes

Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close

When we move, well, you already know

So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine

Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance

A feeling good, good, creeping up on you

So just dance, dance, dance, come on

Gina works the diner all day

she brings home her pay

Tommy's got his six string in hock 

Now he's holding in what he used 

To make it talk 

so tough, it's tough 

Gina dreams of running away 

When she cries in the night 

Tommy whispers baby it's okay, someday 



We've got to hold on to what we've got

You see I've always been a fighter

But without you I give up

Now I can't sing a love song

Like the way it's meant to be

Well, I guess I'm not that good anymore

But baby, that's just me



And I will love you, baby - Always

And I'll be there forever and a day - Always

I'll be there till the stars don't shine

Till the heavens burst and

The words don't rhyme

And I know when I die, you'll be on my mind

And I'll love you - Always



Now your pictures that you left behind

Are just memories of a different life

Some that made us laugh, some that made us cry

One that made you have to say good-bye

What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair

To touch your lips, to hold you near

When you say your prayers try to understand

I've made mistakes, I'm just a man



When he holds you close, when he pulls you near

When he says the words you've been needing to hear

I'll wish I was him 'cause those words are mine

To say to you till the end of time



Yeah, I will love you baby - Always

And I'll be there forever and a day - Always



If you told me to cry for you

I could

If you told me to die for you

I would

Take a look at my face

There's no price I won't pay

To say these words to you

Well, there ain't no luck

In these loaded dice

But baby if you give me just one more try

We can pack up our old dreams

And our old lives

We'll find a place where the sun still shines



And I will love you, baby - Always

And I'll be there forever and a day - Always

I'll be there till the stars don't shine

Till the heavens burst and

I never had the strength to take it higher,

Until I reached the point of no return.

And there's just no turning back,

When your hearts under attack,

Gonna give everything I have,

It's my destiny.

I will never say never! (I will fight)

I will fight till forever! (make it right)

Whenever you knock me down,

I will not stay on the ground.

And I'm fast enough to run across the sea.Ohh

Gonna give everything I have,

I gotcha lil bro.

I can handle him.

Hold up, I

I can handle him.

Now he's bigger than me,

Taller than me.

And he's older than me,


And stronger than me.

And his arms a little bit longer than me.

But he ain't on a JB song with me!

I be trying a chill

They be trying to side with the thrill.

No pun intended, was raised by the power of Will.

Like Luke with the force, when push comes to shove.

Like Cobe with the 4th, ice water with blood. (let's go)

I gotta be the best, and yes

We're the flyest.

Like David and Goliath,

I conquered the giant.

So now I got the world in my hand,

I was born from two stars

So the moon's where I land.

So sue me for being good friends with your friends

Djavan,Oceano,"Assim
Que o día amanheceu
Lá no mar alto da paixão
Dava pra ver o tempo ruir
Cadê você? Que solidão!
Esquecera de mim



Enfim

De tudo que há na terra

Não há nada em lugar nenhum

Que vá crescer sem voce chegar

Longe de ti tudo parou

Ninguém sabe o que eu sofri



Amar é um deserto

E seus temores

Vida que vai na sela

Dessas dores

Não sabe voltar

Me dá teu calor



Vem me fazer feliz

Porque eu te amo

Você deságua em mim

E eu oceano

Esqueço que amar

é quase uma dor

Só sei

Viver

Se for

Por você",MPB

Perdoa, por favor
Eu sei que o erro aconteceu
Mas não sei o que fez
Tudo mudar de vez

Onde foi que eu errei?

Eu só sei que amei,

Que amei, que amei, que amei



Será talvez

Que minha ilusão

Foi dar meu coração

Com toda força

Pra essa moça

Me fazer feliz

E o destino não quis

Me ver como raiz

De uma flor de lis



E foi assim que eu vi

Nosso amor na poeira,

Poeira

Morto na beleza fria de Maria



E o meu jardim da vida

Ressecou, morreu

Do pé que brotou Maria

Nem margarida nasceu



E o meu jardim da vida

Ressecou, morreu

Do pé que brotou Maria

Nem margarida nasceu",MPB

Quer saber?
Quando é assim
Deixa vir do coração
Você sabe que eu só penso em você

Pode ser

Se é assim

Você tem que largar a mão do não

Soltar essa louca, arder de paixão

Não há como doer pra decidir

Só dizer sim ou não

Mas você adora um se...

Eu levo a sério mas você disfarça

Você me diz á  beça e eu nessa de horror

E me remete ao frio que vem lá do Sul

Insiste em zero a zero e eu quero um a um

Aqui ou noutro lugar

Que pode ser feio ou bonito

Se nós estivermos juntos

Haverá um céu azul

Ser teu e de mais ninguém

And you're spending all your time
In this wrong situation
And anytime you want it to stop

I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can


I'll stop time for you
The second you say you'd like me too
I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing
Baby, just to wake up with you
Would be everything I need and this could be so different
Tell me what you want to do
'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can

Give me a sign
Take my hand, we'll be fine
Promise I won't let you down
Just know that you don't
Have to do this alone
Promise I'll never let you down

Depois de fazer uma jogada celestial em gol
Tabelou, driblou dois zagueiros

Deu um toque driblou o goleiro

Só não entrou com bola e tudo

Porque teve humildade em gol



Foi um gol de classe

Onde ele mostrou sua malícia e sua raça



Foi um gol de anjo, um verdadeiro gol de placa

E a magnética agradecida assim cantava
